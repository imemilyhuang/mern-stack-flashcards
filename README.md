## Creative Portion
For the creative portion, we created a multiple-choice quiz feature that shows a vocabulary word with four random potential answers, one of them being correct. After selecting an option, the correct answer will be in green. If you answer incorrectly, it will be highlighted in red. As you answer questions, you'll see a report of your accuracy and the number of questions you've answered correctly over the total questions you've answered.
